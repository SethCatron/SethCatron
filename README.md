# Seth M. Catron

**Entry-Level Software Developer - Recent College Graduate**

I'm a full-stack developer who just graduated from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor of Arts in Computing. Not only do I have an affinity for software, but I also love health and wellness. Most of my projects are from university courses where I was constantly learning new languages/tools/frameworks and tech stacks, having fun with challenging assignments, and improving my approach to problem solving in a software space.
